# ML_Project---House_Price_Prediction

This project predicts house prices using the classic Boston Housing Dataset and the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its accuracy and efficiency. 

###  Project Overview

This project implements an XGBoost Regressor model to predict house prices based on various features in the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset includes information about houses in Boston, Massachusetts, and features like crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax. The XGBoost model will learn the complex relationships between these features and the median housing price, allowing it to make accurate predictions for unseen data.

###  Getting Started

This project requires the following libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn (scikit-learn)
* XGBoost

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
```

###  Data

The project uses the Boston Housing Dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. You can load it directly within your code.

###  Running the Project

The main script (`main.py` or similar) will typically follow these steps:

1. **Load the data:** Load the Boston Housing Dataset using scikit-learn's `load_boston` function.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Training:** Train an XGBoost Regressor model with appropriate hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared. 
5. **(Optional) Save the Model:** Save the trained model for future use.

###  Additional Notes

* This project demonstrates using XGBoost for house price prediction. You can explore tuning the XGBoost hyperparameters for potentially better performance.
* Consider including data visualization to understand the relationships between features and house prices.
*  Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different functionalities of XGBoost.
